# Little-Lemon

<br>

Little Lemon is a charming neighborhood bistro that serves simple food and classic cocktails in a lively but casual environment. The restaurant features a locally sourced menu with daily specials. 

The restaurant is in the process of transition from a one-page website to a database driven web application using the Django framework. Currently, the pages for Home, About and Book are completed.

For the menu page, the owners would like to store the menu information in a database that can be updated as the menu changes seasonally.
